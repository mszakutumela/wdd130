            <h4>Stop Being Lazy</h4>
            <p>99.9% of the time, we are prone to give into temptation when we choose 
                to be idle. We are commanded to not be lazy (D&C 42:42). When we choose to be idle, we cannot be 
                rewarded in any way, just like the bird who traded his feathers for worms.
                "I remember the story of a bird that started to trade his feathers for worms. It was easy to get 
                food that way, and the bird thought he had plenty of feathers. As he continued to trade his feathers, 
                the bird enjoyed not having to get up early to hunt for worms anymore. He could sit in his nest all day 
                and never have to move a muscle. Eventually, however, the bird got too used to this and realized he could 
                no longer fly because he had lost his vital feathers. This can happen to anyone who falls into the trap of 
                bad habits, lazy routines, or use of addictive substances."

            <h4>Health and Wellness For Your Academic Success</h4>
            <p>Welcome to our website. We hope that you will enjoy your visit with us. 
                Depending on your needs, we hope that we can assist you in improving and 
                in helping you to coordinate your health and wellness in a productive way, 
                so that you are able to successfully reach your academic and career goals. 
                You have the power and control over your health and wellness. We believe 
                that as a child God, you have the potential with the Lord's help to become 
                so much more than what you envision for yourself and life.
                You have probably reached our website because you have successfully completed 
                the BYU Pathway Connect World Wide online program. You are now ready to continue 
                your online studies by working towards getting a qualification in your chosen career 
                field at BYU-Idaho.
                As you continue to invite Jesus in your online student life and ask Him to help you. 
                Through your faith, obedience and diligence, you will receive the help that you need, 
                in the same way that the prophet Nephi of old did. He did not know what to do and the 
                Spirit was able to help direct him (1 Nephi 4:6). You can also get the same direction 
                as you create a new wellness plan or as you improve on the one you created during your 
                online studies in the BYU Pathway Connect World Wide program.</p>
