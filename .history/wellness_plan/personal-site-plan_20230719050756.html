        [Welcome to our website. We hope that you will enjoy your visit with us. 
        Depending on your needs, we hope that we can assist you in improving and 
        in helping you to coordinate your health and wellness in a productive way 
        so that you are able to successfully reach your academic and career goals. 
        You have the power and control over your health and wellness. We believe 
        that as a child God, you have the potential with the Lord's help to become 
        so much more than what you envision for yourself and life.
        You have probably reached our website because you have successfully completed 
        the BYU Pathway Connect World Wide online program. You are now ready to continue 
        your online studies by working towards getting a qualification in your chosen career 
        field at BYU-Idaho.
        As you continue to invite Jesus in your online student life and ask Him to help you. 
        Through your faith, obedience and diligence, you will receive the help that you need, 
        in the same way that the prophet Nephi of old did. He did not know what to do and the 
        Spirit was able to help direct him (1 Nephi 4:6). You can also get the same direction 
        as you create a new wellness plan or as you improve on the one you created during your 
        online studies in the BYU Pathway Connect World Wide program.]

        [Stop Being Lazy
        99.9% of the time, we are prone to give into temptation when we choose 
        to be idle. We are commanded to not be lazy (D&C 42:42). When we choose to be idle, we cannot be 
        rewarded in any way, just like the bird who traded his feathers for worms.
        "I remember the story of a bird that started to trade his feathers for worms. It was easy to get 
        food that way, and the bird thought he had plenty of feathers. As he continued to trade his feathers, 
        the bird enjoyed not having to get up early to hunt for worms anymore. He could sit in his nest all day 
        and never have to move a muscle. Eventually, however, the bird got too used to this and realized he could 
        no longer fly because he had lost his vital feathers. This can happen to anyone who falls into the trap of 
        bad habits, lazy routines, or use of addictive substances."

      <h3>[Wellness Plan - page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        [The purpose of the wellness plan is to help you find balance between your family, church, work and 
        online student life. Think about and write down what you want to achieve as you continue and work towards 
        getting a qualification for the career path that you have chosen. Our wellness plan focuses on four key 
        areas in your life: Spiritual, Physical, Social and Intellectual.

        Spiritual Wellness
        Spiritual Wellness is having a good functioning relationship with God, yourself, your heart, and your soul. 
        It is living a life that has meaning and purpose. A life where you have built a culture of regular scripture 
        study and prayer. A life where you attend church and activities often. How is your relationship with Jesus? 
        What can you improve on? What rubbish do you need to remove from your life, so that you can build an even better 
        relationship with Jesus and be a better disciple of Jesus Christ. Choose one goal that you can work on to help you 
        improve your Spiritual Wellness. 

        Physical Wellness
        Physical Wellness is choosing to take better care of your health by exercising regularly, eating healthy food and 
        getting enough sleep. I'm sure you've heard the saying that says that too much of anything is never good. Our bodies 
        are a Temple and we should take good care of our bodies. We need to eat healthy and exercise. Exercising is very good 
        for your brain and it will help you cope with the pressures of being an online student. Choose one goal that you can 
        work on to help you improve your Physical Wellness. 

        Social Wellness
        Social Wellness refers to our interaction with other people and the relationship we have with them. As part of the human 
        family, we all need each other. "No man is an island." When you remove one charcoal from a group of burning coal, it will 
        not survive by itself. It will slowly give up the heat and die. We need to nurture and take good care of our different 
        relationships, because these relationships can help us during difficult times in our lives. Choose one goal that you can 
        work on to help you improve your Social Wellness. 

        Intellectual Wellness
        Intellectual Wellness involves continuous learning in every aspect of. It is an area in your life where you have the opportunity 
        to learn, grow and develop your talents. As you continue with your online studies, you are fulfilling this role by expanding your 
        knowledge, talents and skills. Choose one goal that you can work on to help you improve your Intellectual Wellness.]
