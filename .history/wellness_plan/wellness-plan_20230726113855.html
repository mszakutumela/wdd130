            <p>The purpose of the wellness plan is to help you find balance between your family, church, work and 
                online student life. Think about and write down what you want to achieve as you continue and work towards 
                getting a qualification for the career path that you have chosen. Our wellness plan focuses on four key 
                areas in your life: Spiritual, Physical, Social and Intellectual.</p>

                    <p>Spiritual Wellness is having a good functioning relationship with God, yourself, your heart, and your soul. 
                        It is living a life that has meaning and purpose. A life where you have built a culture of regular scripture 
                        study and prayer. A life where you attend church and activities often. How is your relationship with Jesus? 
                        What can you improve on? What rubbish do you need to remove from your life, so that you can build an even better 
                        relationship with Jesus and be a better disciple of Jesus Christ. Choose one goal that you can work on to help you 
                        improve your Spiritual Wellness.

                <div>
                    <p>Physical Wellness is choosing to take better care of your health by exercising regularly, eating healthy food and 
                        getting enough sleep. I'm sure you've heard the saying that says that too much of anything is never good. Our bodies 
                        are a Temple and we should take good care of our bodies. We need to eat healthy and exercise. Exercising is very good 
                        for your brain and it will help you cope with the pressures of being an online student. Choose one goal that you can 
                        work on to help you improve your Physical Wellness.

                <div>
                    <p>Social Wellness refers to our interaction with other people and the relationship we have with them. As part of the human 
                        family, we all need each other. "No man is an island." When you remove one charcoal from a group of burning coal, it will 
                        not survive by itself. It will slowly give up the heat and die. We need to nurture and take good care of our different 
                        relationships, because these relationships can help us during difficult times in our lives. Choose one goal that you can 
                        work on to help you improve your Social Wellness.

                    <p>Intellectual Wellness involves continuous learning in every aspect of. It is an area in your life where you have the opportunity 
                        to learn, grow and develop your talents. As you continue with your online studies, you are fulfilling this role by expanding your 
                        knowledge, talents and skills. Choose one goal that you can work on to help you improve your Intellectual Wellness.
