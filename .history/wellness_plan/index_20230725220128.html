            <h4>Health and Wellness For Your Academic Success</h4>
            <p>Welcome to our website. We hope that you will enjoy your visit with us. 
                    Depending on your needs, we hope that we can assist you in improving and 
                    in helping you to coordinate your health and wellness in a productive way, 
                    so that you are able to successfully reach your academic and career goals. 
                    You have the power and control over your health and wellness. We believe 
                    that as a child God, you have the potential with the Lord's help to become 
                    so much more than what you envision for yourself and life.
                    You have probably reached our website because you have successfully completed 
                    the BYU Pathway Connect World Wide online program. You are now ready to continue 
                    your online studies by working towards getting a qualification in your chosen career 
                    field at BYU-Idaho. br
                    As you continue to invite Jesus in your online student life and ask Him to help you. 
                    Through your faith, obedience and diligence, you will receive the help that you need, 
                    in the same way that the prophet Nephi of old did. He did not know what to do and the 
                    Spirit was able to help direct him (1 Nephi 4:6). You can also get the same direction 
                    as you create a new wellness plan or as you improve on the one you created during your 
                    online studies in the BYU Pathway Connect World Wide program.</p>
