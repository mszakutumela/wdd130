            <h4>Stop Being Lazy</h4>
            <p>99.9% of the time, we are prone to give into temptation when we choose 
                to be idle. We are commanded to not be lazy (D&C 42:42). When we choose to be idle, we cannot be 
                rewarded in any way, just like the bird who traded his feathers for worms.
                "I remember the story of a bird that started to trade his feathers for worms. It was easy to get 
                food that way, and the bird thought he had plenty of feathers. As he continued to trade his feathers, 
                the bird enjoyed not having to get up early to hunt for worms anymore. He could sit in his nest all day 
                and never have to move a muscle. Eventually, however, the bird got too used to this and realized he could 
                no longer fly because he had lost his vital feathers. This can happen to anyone who falls into the trap of 
                bad habits, lazy routines, or use of addictive substances."
