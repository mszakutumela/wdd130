        <h5>Is this a good trip for kids?</h5>
        <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. 
            A common concern we get from parents is that their children 
            will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly 
            we deal with very few bored children of any age.  </p>
    </section>
    <section class="question 2">
        <h5>Is whitewater rafting safe?</h5>
        <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. 
            To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid 
            and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries 
            are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="question 3">
        <h5>I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h5>
        <p>Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal 
            flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. 
            Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins 
            explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

        <h5>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h5>
        <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages.

            bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and 
            a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. We provided water and lemonade

        <h2>Highlights From The Past Season</h2>
        <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. 
            This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places 
            on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family.</p>
            <!-- The season started off with some chilly 
            weather. Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon. We didn't have any 
            trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p> -->
