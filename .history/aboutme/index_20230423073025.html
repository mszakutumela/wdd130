    <h3>Mama Amulek</h3>
    <p>My name is Ayanda. I'm from South Africa. I currently live in Centurion. I'm currently a single Mom 
        to a very busy almost 3 year old toddler. He is the sunshine of my life. I currently work for the     
        South African Police Service as a Communication Officer. I love my Savior, Jesus Christ and His 
        Gospel very much. It is all because of Him, after everything that I've been through, that I've 
        come this far in my life. </p>
    <p>What keeps me going from day to day is to: 
        1. Look to the Savior always, He is the answer to everything, 
        2. Choose obedience by trying my best to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ each day and align my life with His will for me, 
        3. Keep positive, 
        4. Keep moving forward no matter what, and 
        5. Focus on solutions.</p>
